### Bury a Card:

Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review until the next day. (If you want to unbury cards before then, you 
can click the “unbury” button on the deck overview screen.) This is useful if you cannot answer the card at the moment 
or you want to come back to it another time. Burying can also happen automatically for cards of the same note.

### Suspend a Card / Note: 

Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review until they are manually unsuspended (by clicking the suspend button 
in the browser). This is useful if you want to avoid reviewing the note for some time, but don’t want to delete it. With 
the old scheduler, if cards were in learning when they are suspended, they are moved back to the new card queue or 
review queue prior to being suspended.
