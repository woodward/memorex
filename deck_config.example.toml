# An example deck config TOML file

# If your deck is a directory, create a file in it called `deck_config.toml`.
# If your deck is a single markdown file (e.g., called `my-deck.md`) you can create
# a sibling file called `my-deck.deck_config.toml`) and it will be read in.

# For TOML, see: [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)

# See [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) for a description of the duration formats.
# E.g., "P2D" means 2 days, "PT10M" means 10 minutes, "P100Y" means 100 years, 
# "PT1H15M30S" means 1 hour, 15 minutes, 30 seconds, "P1DT3H" means 1 day, 3 hours.

# Note that you only need to include values where you are overriding the defaults 
# (i.e., you do not need to specify all of these values). Your deck_config.toml file can contain only
# a few lines (if you are only overriding a few values).
